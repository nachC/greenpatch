# GreenPatch

**Development project using Nativescript + Angular and Couchbase Lite.**

GreenPatch is an Android app that helps the user documentate the growth of their plants/crops.
It features 'plant profiles' where you can add a profile picture, set dates for when you have planted and when you expect to harvest, add notes and an image galery.

The data is saved locally using Couchbase Lite.
